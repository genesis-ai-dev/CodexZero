# UI Design Rule: No Stats Cards or Metric Dashboards

## Prohibited UI Patterns

**NEVER** create UI elements that are squares, cards, or containers that primarily display:
- Large numbers with labels underneath
- Stats cards / KPI dashboards  
- Metrics grids
- Summary statistics displays
- "At-a-glance metrics"
- Dashboard widgets with just numbers
- Info cards that are just numerical data

## Examples of What NOT to Create

```html
<!-- FORBIDDEN: Stats cards with numbers -->
<div class="stats-grid">
    <div class="stat-card">
        <div class="big-number">42</div>
        <div class="label">Total Projects</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stat-card">
        <div class="big-number">156</div>
        <div class="label">Active Users</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Preferred Alternatives

Instead of stats cards, integrate metrics naturally into:
- Headers with contextual information
- Inline text within content sections
- Progress indicators within functional elements
- Badges or counters on actionable items
- Data visualization that serves a functional purpose

## Design Philosophy

Focus on **functional, content-rich interfaces** rather than numerical summaries that don't provide actionable value. Every UI element should have a clear purpose beyond just displaying a number.
