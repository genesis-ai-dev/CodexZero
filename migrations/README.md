# Migrations Directory

## Status: ✅ All Migrations Complete

All database migrations have been successfully applied and the migration logic has been removed from `app.py`.

### Current Schema State
- ✅ Verse edit history system implemented
- ✅ Text type column removed (unified text storage)
- ✅ Fine-tuning job columns added
- ✅ Project members system in place
- ✅ All indexes optimized

### For Future Migrations
If you need to add new database migrations:

1. Create new migration files in this directory
2. Add migration logic to `app.py` if needed
3. Test thoroughly before deploying to production

### Note
The old migration files have been removed since they are no longer needed. The current database schema is the source of truth.
