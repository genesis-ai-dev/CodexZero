                            File pairing links two files that are line-by-line translations of each other (like English and Spanish versions of the same text). This is essential for fine-tuning custom AI models and providing translation examples. Upload both files to your project, then click the "Pair" button next to one file and select the matching file.

                        <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-neutral-900 mb-3">What is fine-tuning and should I use it?</h3>
                        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
                            Fine-tuning creates custom AI models trained on your specific translation pairs. This significantly improves translation quality for your target language and style. You need paired files with at least 50 examples (500+ recommended). Training takes 1-3 hours, and the system provides cost estimates before starting.

                            CodexZero supports .txt files (UTF-8 encoded), USFM files (.usfm, .sfm) from Paratext, and direct text pasting. The system automatically detects USFM format and provides specialized import tools. You can also import from the built-in eBible corpus.

                        <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-neutral-900 mb-3">How do translation instructions work?</h3>
                        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
                            Translation instructions are custom guidelines that help the AI understand your specific needs. Include guidance like "Use simple vocabulary for young adults," "Avoid passive voice," or "Maintain formal tone in prayer passages." The more specific you are, the better the AI will follow your style preferences.
